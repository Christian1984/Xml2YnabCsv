You Need A Budget (YNAB) XML-Parser

This XML parser was written in order to parse xml files from banks into a YNAB compatible csv-file.

The implementation includes:
- all necessary code to parse Postbank xml files into ynab csv

Input xml-file goes in folder xml, must be calles in.xml
Output file will be written in folder csv, calles in.xml.csv

TODOs:
- implement command line options to open any given xml file (simple)
- create a parser interface/abstract class, make different classes for individual banks/xml structures (simple)
- implement a GUI (medium)
- implement other xml structures (e.g. Sparkasse) (medium)

Feel free to implement the ideas and todos above or add your own two cents. 
Fork it, play with it, modify it and please report bugs! ;-)
